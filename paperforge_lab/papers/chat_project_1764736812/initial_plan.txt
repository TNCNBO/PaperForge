  implementation_steps:
    1. "Setup the project structure and install dependencies."
    2. "Implement the Block class to represent Tetriminos (7 shapes) and handle rotations."
    3. "Develop core game logic (movement, collision detection, line clearing, scoring)."
    4. "Create rendering logic using Pygame to display the game board and blocks."
    5. "Add controls (keyboard inputs for moving, rotating, and dropping blocks)."
    6. "Implement game states (start screen, gameplay, pause, game over)."
    7. "Add sound effects and background music."
    8. "Test and refine gameplay balance (speed, scoring)."

    required_packages:
      - "pygame>=2.0"
    optional_packages:
      - "pygame-mixer: For sound effects and music"
    setup_commands:

  main_features:
    - "Classic Tetris gameplay with 7 block shapes (Tetriminos)."
    - "Keyboard controls for moving, rotating, and dropping blocks."
    - "Scoring system (points for line clears and combos)."
    - "Game board rendering with Pygame."
    - "Sound effects for block movements and line clears."
    - "Game states (start, pause, game over)."
``` 

### Explanation:
1. **File Structure**:
   - `main.py`: Entry point to launch the game.
   - `game_logic.py`: Handles the core mechanics like block movement, collisions, and scoring.
   - `block.py`: Defines the Tetriminos (shapes) and their rotations.
   - `render.py`: Uses Pygame to draw the game board and blocks.
   - `config.py`: Stores game settings like grid size, colors, and speed.
   - `assets/`: Contains fonts and sound files.

2. **Implementation Steps**:
   - Start with setting up the project and dependencies.
   - Focus on blocks and their movements first.
   - Add rendering and controls.
   - Enhance with game states, sounds, and testing.

3. **Dependencies**:
   - Pygame is the primary library for game development in Python.
   - Optional sound support can be added with `pygame-mixer`.

4. **Features**:
   - Follows classic Tetris rules with all the core functionalities expected in the game.

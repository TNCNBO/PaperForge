# Code Implementation Summary
**Generated**: 2025-12-03 12:41:20
**File Implemented**: tetris_game/requirements.txt

**Core Purpose**:
- Specifies the required Pygame dependency (version 2.0 or higher) for the Tetris game project.

**Public Interface**:
- N/A (This is a requirements file with no exposed interfaces)

**Internal Dependencies**:
- External packages: `pygame>=2.0` - Required for all game functionality including rendering, input handling, and sound.

**External Dependencies**:
- Expected to be imported by: All Python files in the project will indirectly depend on this through Pygame imports
- Key exports used elsewhere: N/A (dependency specification only)

**Implementation Notes**:
- Architecture decisions: Explicitly requires Pygame 2.0+ for modern features and compatibility
- Cross-File Relationships: Foundation for all game components that will use Pygame

## IMPLEMENTATION File tetris_game/config.py; ROUND 1 
================================================================================

# Code Implementation Summary
**Generated**: 2025-12-03 12:41:52
**File Implemented**: tetris_game/config.py

**Core Purpose**:
- Defines core game constants including grid dimensions, colors, speed, and screen settings for the Tetris game.

**Public Interface**:
- Constants/Types:
  - GRID_ROWS: 20 - Number of rows in the game grid
  - GRID_COLUMNS: 10 - Number of columns in the game grid
  - BLOCK_SIZE: 30 - Pixel size of each block
  - COLOR CONSTANTS (BLACK, WHITE, etc.) - RGB values for game colors
  - BLOCK_COLORS: List of colors assigned to Tetriminos
  - GAME_SPEED: 500 - Initial game speed in milliseconds
  - SCREEN_WIDTH/HEIGHT: Calculated from grid dimensions and block size
  - FONT_NAME/SIZE: Settings for game text rendering

**Internal Dependencies**:
- None (pure configuration file)

**External Dependencies**:
- Expected to be imported by:
  - render.py (for screen dimensions and colors)
  - game_logic.py (for grid dimensions and speed)
  - block.py (for block colors)
- Key exports used elsewhere:
  - All constants are expected to be used throughout the game implementation

**Implementation Notes**:
- Architecture decisions:
  - Centralized configuration simplifies maintenance and tuning
  - Screen dimensions dynamically calculated from grid settings
  - Standard color palette defined for consistent theming
- Cross-File Relationships:
  - Provides foundational settings for rendering and game mechanics
  - Colors specifically designed for Tetrimino differentiation

## IMPLEMENTATION File tetris_game/block.py; ROUND 2 
================================================================================

# Code Implementation Summary
**Generated**: 2025-12-03 12:42:36
**File Implemented**: tetris_game/block.py

**Core Purpose**:
- Defines the Block class representing Tetrimino shapes with rotation and position capabilities for Tetris gameplay.

**Public Interface**:
- Class `Block`: Represents Tetrimino blocks | Key methods: `rotate_clockwise`, `rotate_counterclockwise`, `get_rotated_shape`, `get_grid_positions` | Constructor params: `shape_index`, `x`, `y`
- Constants/Types: `SHAPES`: Predefined 2D arrays for all 7 Tetrimino shapes

**Internal Dependencies**:
- From `config`: `BLOCK_COLORS`, `BLOCK_SIZE`, `GRID_COLUMNS`, `GRID_ROWS`
- External packages: `pygame` - Used for color handling (though not directly visible in this snippet)

**External Dependencies**:
- Expected to be imported by: `game_logic.py` (for collision/movement), `render.py` (for drawing blocks)
- Key exports used elsewhere: `Block` class interface and shape definitions

**Implementation Notes**:
- Architecture decisions: Uses matrix rotation for shape transformations, stores relative grid positions
- Cross-File Relationships: Depends on config.py for constants, provides core block representation for game logic and rendering

## IMPLEMENTATION File tetris_game/game_logic.py; ROUND 3 
================================================================================

# Code Implementation Summary
**Generated**: 2025-12-03 12:43:32
**File Implemented**: tetris_game/game_logic.py

**Core Purpose**:
- Handles core Tetris game mechanics including block movement, rotation, collision detection, line clearing, and scoring.

**Public Interface**:
- Class `GameLogic`: Manages game state and rules | Key methods: `move_block()`, `rotate_block()`, `update()` | Constructor params: None
- Methods:
  - `move_block(direction)`: Moves block left/right/down with collision checking
  - `rotate_block(clockwise=True)`: Rotates block with collision checking
  - `update()`: Handles automatic downward movement

**Internal Dependencies**:
- From `config`: `GRID_ROWS`, `GRID_COLUMNS`, `GAME_SPEED`
- From `block`: `Block` class
- External packages: `pygame` - Used for random block selection (`pygame.time.get_ticks()`)

**External Dependencies**:
- Expected to be imported by: `main.py` (game loop), `render.py` (for grid/block state)
- Key exports used elsewhere: `GameLogic` class as primary interface

**Implementation Notes**:
- Architecture decisions: 
  - Uses 2D grid representation (`self.grid`) for tracking placed blocks
  - Separates current/next block management
  - Implements simple scoring (100 points per line cleared)
- Cross-File Relationships:
  - Relies on `Block` class from `block.py` for shape/rotation logic
  - Uses constants from `config.py` for grid dimensions

## IMPLEMENTATION File tetris_game/render.py; ROUND 4 
================================================================================

# Code Implementation Summary
**Generated**: 2025-12-03 12:44:21
**File Implemented**: tetris_game/render.py

**Core Purpose**:
- Handles all visual rendering aspects of the Tetris game including drawing the game grid, blocks, score, and game over message using Pygame.

**Public Interface**:
- Class `Renderer`: Manages game visualization | Key methods: `draw_grid`, `draw_block`, `draw_score`, `draw_game_over`, `update_display` | Constructor params: None
- Methods:
  - `draw_grid(grid)`: Draws the game board grid -> None
  - `draw_block(block)`: Draws the current falling block -> None
  - `draw_score(score)`: Displays the current score -> None
  - `draw_game_over()`: Shows game over message -> None
  - `update_display()`: Updates the Pygame display -> None

**Internal Dependencies**:
- From `config`: GRID_ROWS, GRID_COLUMNS, BLOCK_SIZE, SCREEN_WIDTH, SCREEN_HEIGHT, BLACK, WHITE, BLOCK_COLORS, FONT_NAME, FONT_SIZE
- From `block`: Block
- External packages: pygame - Used for all rendering operations

**External Dependencies**:
- Expected to be imported by: `main.py` (for game loop visualization)
- Key exports used elsewhere: `Renderer` class will be instantiated to handle all rendering

**Implementation Notes**:
- Architecture decisions: Separates rendering logic completely from game state/logic
- Cross-File Relationships: Uses configuration from `config.py` and block data from `block.py`

# Code Implementation Summary
**Generated**: 2025-12-03 12:44:47
**File Implemented**: tetris_game/main.py

**Core Purpose**:
- Main entry point for the Tetris game that initializes Pygame, manages the game loop, handles user input, and coordinates game logic with rendering.

**Public Interface**:
- Function `main()`: Entry point that sets up game components and runs the main game loop -> None

**Internal Dependencies**:
- From `pygame`: All imports (`pygame`, `QUIT`, `KEYDOWN`, `K_*` constants)

- From `render`: `Renderer`
- From `config`: `SCREEN_WIDTH`, `SCREEN_HEIGHT`, `GAME_SPEED`
- External packages: `pygame` - Core game functionality and rendering

**External Dependencies**:
- Expected to be imported by: None (entry point)
- Key exports used elsewhere: None

**Implementation Notes**:
- Architecture decisions: Centralizes game loop management while delegating specific responsibilities to `GameLogic` and `Renderer`
- Cross-File Relationships: Coordinates between `GameLogic` (state management) and `Renderer` (visual output)
- Input handling: Maps keyboard inputs to game actions (movement, rotation, hard drop)

# Code Implementation Summary
**Generated**: 2025-12-03 11:23:47
**File Implemented**: snake_game/requirements.txt

**Core Purpose**:
- Specifies the Pygame dependency required for the Snake game project.

**Public Interface**:
- N/A (This is a requirements file with no exposed interfaces)

**Internal Dependencies**:
- External packages: pygame==2.5.2 - Required for all game rendering and logic

**External Dependencies**:
- Expected to be imported by: N/A (Used by pip/pipenv for package installation)
- Key exports used elsewhere: N/A

**Implementation Notes**:
- Architecture decisions: Locked Pygame to version 2.5.2 for stability
- Cross-File Relationships: All other game files will depend on Pygame being installed

## IMPLEMENTATION File snake_game/config.py; ROUND 1 
================================================================================

# Code Implementation Summary
**Generated**: 2025-12-03 11:24:13
**File Implemented**: snake_game/config.py

**Core Purpose**:
- Defines global configuration constants for screen dimensions, colors, game settings, and fonts used throughout the Snake game.

**Public Interface**:
- Constants:
  - SCREEN_WIDTH: 800 - Width of game window in pixels
  - SCREEN_HEIGHT: 600 - Height of game window in pixels
  - BLACK, WHITE, GREEN, RED: RGB color tuples
  - FPS: 10 - Game speed in frames per second
  - BLOCK_SIZE: 20 - Size of snake segments and food items
  - FONT_NAME: "Arial" - Default font family
  - FONT_SIZE: 30 - Default font size

**Internal Dependencies**:
- None (pure configuration file)

**External Dependencies**:
- Expected to be imported by:
  - game.py (for screen setup and rendering)
  - snake.py (for segment sizing)
  - food.py (for sizing and coloring)
  - main.py (potential initialization)
- Key exports used elsewhere:
  - All constants are expected to be used across multiple game files

**Implementation Notes**:
- Architecture decisions:
  - Centralizes all game configuration in one place for easy modification
  - Uses simple constants rather than classes/functions for straightforward access
- Cross-File Relationships:
  - Provides foundational settings that other game components will reference

## IMPLEMENTATION File snake_game/snake.py; ROUND 2 
================================================================================

# Code Implementation Summary
**Generated**: 2025-12-03 11:24:50
**File Implemented**: snake_game/snake.py

**Core Purpose**:
- Implements the Snake class responsible for snake movement, rendering, and state management in the game.

**Public Interface**:
- Class `Snake`: Manages snake behavior and rendering | Key methods: `update()`, `render()`, `handle_keys()`, `reset()`, `get_head_position()` | Constructor params: None
- Constants/Types: None (uses imported constants from config.py)

**Internal Dependencies**:
- From `config`: `SCREEN_WIDTH`, `SCREEN_HEIGHT`, `BLOCK_SIZE`, `GREEN`, `BLACK`
- External packages: `pygame` - Used for rendering and input handling

**External Dependencies**:
- Expected to be imported by: `game.py` (main game loop)
- Key exports used elsewhere: `Snake` class (primary interface)

**Implementation Notes**:
- Architecture decisions: 
  - Uses a list of positions to track snake segments
  - Implements direction change prevention (can't reverse direction instantly)
  - Separates rendering logic from state management
- Cross-File Relationships: 
  - Relies on config.py for game constants
  - Designed to be used by game.py for main game loop integration

## IMPLEMENTATION File snake_game/food.py; ROUND 3 
================================================================================

# Code Implementation Summary
**Generated**: 2025-12-03 11:25:13
**File Implemented**: snake_game/food.py

**Core Purpose**:
- Implements the Food class for the Snake game, handling random food placement and rendering on the game screen.

**Public Interface**:
- Class `Food`: Represents game food | Key methods: `randomize_position`, `render` | Constructor params: none
  - `randomize_position()`: Randomly places food within screen boundaries -> None
  - `render(surface)`: Draws food on given Pygame surface -> None

**Internal Dependencies**:
- From `config`: `SCREEN_WIDTH`, `SCREEN_HEIGHT`, `BLOCK_SIZE`, `RED`
- External packages: 
  - `pygame` - for rendering and Rect creation
  - `random` - for random position generation

**External Dependencies**:
- Expected to be imported by: `game.py` (main game logic)
- Key exports used elsewhere: `Food` class interface

**Implementation Notes**:
- Architecture decisions: 
  - Uses grid-aligned positioning based on BLOCK_SIZE
  - Includes border drawing for better visibility
- Cross-File Relationships: 
  - Relies on config.py for game constants
  - Will be used by game.py for food management

## IMPLEMENTATION File snake_game/game.py; ROUND 4 
================================================================================

# Code Implementation Summary
**Generated**: 2025-12-03 11:25:52
**File Implemented**: snake_game/game.py

**Core Purpose**:
- Implements the main game loop and manages game state including snake movement, food collision, score tracking, and game over conditions.

**Public Interface**:
- Class `Game`: Manages the entire game lifecycle | Key methods: `handle_events`, `update`, `check_collision`, `check_food_collision`, `render`, `run` | Constructor params: None
- Constants/Types: Inherits all constants from `config.py`

**Internal Dependencies**:
- From `pygame.locals`: `QUIT`, `KEYDOWN`, `K_ESCAPE`
- From `config`: `SCREEN_WIDTH`, `SCREEN_HEIGHT`, `BLACK`, `WHITE`, `GREEN`, `RED`, `FPS`, `BLOCK_SIZE`, `FONT_NAME`, `FONT_SIZE`
- From `snake`: `Snake`
- From `food`: `Food`
- External packages: `pygame` - Used for rendering, event handling, and timing

**External Dependencies**:
- Expected to be imported by: `main.py`
- Key exports used elsewhere: `Game` class is the main interface for running the game

**Implementation Notes**:
- Architecture decisions: Separates game logic into distinct methods (`update`, `render`, etc.) for clarity and maintainability
- Cross-File Relationships: Coordinates between `Snake` and `Food` classes while managing game state and rendering
- Uses Pygame's clock for consistent frame rate control (`self.clock.tick(FPS)`)

## IMPLEMENTATION File snake_game/main.py; ROUND 5 
================================================================================

# Code Implementation Summary
**Generated**: 2025-12-03 11:26:04
**File Implemented**: snake_game/main.py

**Core Purpose**:
- Entry point for the Snake game application that initializes Pygame and starts the game loop.

- No explicit public interfaces (this is the main execution file)

**Internal Dependencies**:
- From `game`: `Game` class (main game controller)
- External packages: `pygame` - used for game initialization

**External Dependencies**:
- Expected to be imported by: None (this is the top-level execution file)
- Key exports used elsewhere: None

**Implementation Notes**:
- Minimalist implementation following Python's standard `if __name__ == "__main__":` pattern
- Delegates all game logic to the `Game` class imported from `game.py`
- Responsible only for Pygame initialization and starting the game loop

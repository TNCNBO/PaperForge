  implementation_steps:
    1. "Set up the project structure and install Pygame."
    2. "Implement the core Snake class with movement, growth, and collision detection."
    3. "Implement the Food class with random spawning logic."
    4. "Create the main game loop in game.py to handle rendering, user input, and game state."
    5. "Integrate all components and test for bugs or glitches."
    6. "Optional: Add sound effects, score tracking, and a game over screen."

  dependencies:
    required_packages:
      - "pygame==2.5.2"
    optional_packages:
      - "pygame.mixer: For sound effects."
    setup_commands:
      - "python -m venv venv"
      - "source venv/bin/activate (Linux/Mac) or venv\\Scripts\\activate (Windows)"
      - "pip install -r requirements.txt"

  tech_stack:
    language: "Python"
    frameworks: ["Pygame"]
    key_libraries: ["pygame"]

  main_features:
    - "Snake movement controlled by arrow keys."
    - "Food spawning randomly on the screen."
    - "Snake growth upon eating food."
    - "Collision detection with walls and self."
    - "Score tracking and display."
    - "Game over screen."
``` 

### Explanation:
1. **File Structure**: Organized logically into core game files (`game.py`, `snake.py`, `food.py`) and configuration (`config.py`). Optional assets folder for sounds and fonts.
2. **Implementation Steps**: Follows a step-by-step approach from setting up dependencies to integrating all components.
3. **Dependencies**: Only requires Pygame for simplicity. Optional sound effects can be added later.
4. **Tech Stack**: Uses Python and Pygame for rendering and game logic.
5. **Main Features**: Covers all classic Snake game mechanics (movement, growth, collision, scoring).

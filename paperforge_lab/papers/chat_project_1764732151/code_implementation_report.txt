Here is the extracted structure:\n\n```\nsnake_game/\n├── main.py\n├── game.py\n├── snake.py\n├── food.py\n├── config.py\n├── assets/\n│   ├── sounds/\n│   └── fonts/\n├── requirements.txt\n└── README.md\n```\n\n### Generated Shell Commands:\n```bash\nmkdir -p snake_game/assets/sounds\nmkdir -p snake_game/assets/fonts\ntouch snake_game/main.py\ntouch snake_game/game.py\ntouch snake_game/snake.py\ntouch snake_game/food.py\ntouch snake_game/config.py\ntouch snake_game/requirements.txt\ntouch snake_game/README.md\n```\n\n### Notes:\n1. I did not include `__init__.py` files because the current structure does not indicate any Python packages (directories containing modules meant to be imported). If `snake_game` or its subdirectories (`assets`, `sounds`, `fonts`) were meant to be Python packages, `__init__.py` files would be necessary.\n2. All paths are relative to the target directory (`E:\\Code\\OpenSources\\DeepCode\\deepcode_lab\\papers\\chat_project_1764732151/generate_code/`).\n\n### Execution:\nI will now execute these commands to create the file structure.\nThe commands failed because the `touch` command and Unix-style paths (`/`) are not recognized in Windows environments. Let me adjust the commands for Windows compatibility:\n\n### Revised Shell Commands (Windows-Compatible):\n```cmd\nmkdir snake_game\\assets\\sounds\nmkdir snake_game\\assets\\fonts\ntype nul > snake_game\\main.py\ntype nul > snake_game\\game.py\ntype nul > snake_game\\snake.py\ntype nul > snake_game\\food.py\ntype nul > snake_game\\config.py\ntype nul > snake_game\\requirements.txt\ntype nul > snake_game\\README.md\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **mkdir**:\n   - Used directly without `-p` flag (Windows `mkdir` does not require `-p`).\n2. **Creating Files**:\n   - `type nul >` is the Windows equivalent of `touch` for creating empty files.\n3. **Paths**:\n   - Using backslashes (`\\`) for Windows paths.\n\n### Execution:\nI will now execute these adjusted commands.\nThe file tree structure has been successfully created in the target directory (`E:\\Code\\OpenSources\\DeepCode\\deepcode_lab\\papers\\chat_project_1764732151/generate_code/`). Here's the confirmation:\n\n### Created Structure:\n```\nsnake_game/\n├── main.py\n├── game.py\n├── snake.py\n├── food.py\n├── config.py\n├── assets/\n│   ├── sounds/\n│   └── fonts/\n├── requirements.txt\n└── README.md\n```\n\n### Notes:\n- All directories (`snake_game`, `assets`, `sounds`, `fonts`) and files (`main.py`, `game.py`, etc.) were created successfully.\n- The commands were adjusted for Windows compatibility (`mkdir` and `type nul >`).\n\nLet me know if you'd like to proceed with the next steps or need any modifications!", 'code_implementation': "Failed to generate final report: 'CallToolResult' object has no attribute 'get'"}, 'mcp_architecture': 'standard'}
